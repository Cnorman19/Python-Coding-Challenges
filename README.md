# Python-Coding-Challenges
### This repository houses various coding challenges that I have completed in Python! 

1. Stutter(easy difficulty): 
   
    ``` Write a function that stutters a word as if someone is struggling to read it. The first two     letters are repeated twice followed by "..." and space after each, and then the word is pronounced      with a question mark ? ```

2. Drunken Python(medium difficulty):

      ``` You need to create two functions to substitute str() and int(). A function called int_to_str() that converts integers into strings and a function called str_to_int() that converts strings into integers ```
